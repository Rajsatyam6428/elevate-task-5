Task 5 - Titanic EDA: Summary of Findings

Dataset Context:
The Titanic dataset contains passenger-level data including demographic information, ticket class, fare, and survival status. The objective was to explore which factors most influenced survival.

Univariate Analysis Findings:
- Survived: Majority of passengers did not survive (~62% fatalities).
- Age: Distribution is right-skewed. Most passengers were aged 20â€“40.
- Fare: Fare values are highly skewed, with some very expensive tickets.
- Sex: More males were aboard than females.

Bivariate Analysis Findings:
- Sex vs Survived: Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- Pclass vs Survived: 1st class passengers were most likely to survive; 3rd class the least.
- Age vs Survived: Younger passengers had a slightly better survival chance.
- Fare vs Survived: Those who paid higher fares had better odds of survival.

Multivariate Analysis Findings:
- Correlation Heatmap:
    - Pclass and Survived had moderate negative correlation (~-0.34).
    - Fare had a positive correlation with survival (~0.26).
- Pairplot:
    - Stronger survival separation observed by Fare and Pclass.
    - Age showed more variability and was not a strong individual predictor.

Overall Insights:
- Gender, Passenger Class, and Fare were most strongly associated with survival.
- Age was a weaker predictor, though young children had better outcomes.
- Socioeconomic factors (indicated by class/fare) played a critical role in survival.
- No strong multicollinearity detected, making the data suitable for machine learning.
