 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🎯 Objective
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify key patterns, relationships, and insights that influenced passenger survival.


## 📁 Files Used
- `train.csv` – Training data with labeled survival outcomes
- `test.csv` – Testing data (no survival column)
- `gender_submission.csv` – Sample submission format


## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (in VS Code)


## 📊 Key Visuals & Analyses
- **Univariate Analysis:**
  - Histogram of Age
  - Countplot of Survival
- **Bivariate Analysis:**
  - Survival by Gender (`Sex`)
  - Survival by Passenger Class (`Pclass`)
  - Age vs Survival (Boxplot)
- **Multivariate Analysis:**
  - Correlation Heatmap
  - Pairplot of Age, Fare, Pclass vs Survival


## 📌 Observations Summary
- **Women and children** had higher survival rates.
- **1st class passengers** were more likely to survive than 2nd or 3rd class.
- **Higher fare** generally correlated with higher survival probability.
- `Pclass` and `Fare` were moderately correlated; socioeconomic status influenced survival.
- No major multicollinearity detected between features.


## 📤 Outputs
- ✅ Jupyter Notebook (`eda_titanic.ipynb`)
- ✅ PDF Report (`EDA_titanic.pdf`)
- ✅ summary Report (`Titanic_EDA_Findings.txt`)
- ✅ Cleaned Titanic Datasets (used directly)
